# SnClient

## Overview
SnClient is an open-source Minecraft client designed to enhance the gaming experience by improving performance and offering built-in modes tailored for PvP (Player vs. Player) and PvE (Player vs. Environment) gameplay. Inspired by clients like Lunar Client and Badlion Client, SnClient aims to provide a lightweight, customizable, and high-performance alternative while maintaining transparency through its open-source nature. Built with .NET MAUI and integrated with ProjBobcat for seamless Minecraft launching, SnClient leverages modern authentication (via MSAL) and Forge mod support to deliver a robust platform for Minecraft enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized rendering and resource management for smoother gameplay, even on lower-end devices.
- **Built-in PvP Presets**: Enhances combat mechanics, including hit registration, and customizable HUDs for competitive play.
- **Built-in PvE Presets**: Improves exploration and survival.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent codebase, encouraging community contributions and customizations.
- **Forge Integration**: Supports Forge mods (e.g., 1.8.9-forge1.8.9-11.15.1.2318) for extended functionality.
- **Modern Authentication**: Uses MSAL for secure Microsoft account login with persistent caching.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with .NET MAUI, targeting Windows, macOS, and potentially other platforms.
- **Customizable**: Extensible architecture for adding new features or modes.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Implement PvP mode with aim assist and HUD customization.
- [ ] Develop PvE mode with auto-farming and mob tracking.
- [ ] Add performance profiling tools.
